# nlp-playground

## Objective

**Project Name: NLP Playground**

**Description:**

NLP Playground is an interactive application designed to help users understand and explore key concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Python and the popular NLP library, SpaCy. The application provides a hands-on environment for learning and experimenting with various NLP techniques, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition (NER), dependency parsing, text classification, and more.

Key Features:
- **Tokenization**: Split text into words, phrases, or sentences for further analysis.
- **POS Tagging**: Identify the part of speech for each word in a sentence.
- **Dependency Parsing**: Understand the grammatical structure of sentences by analyzing word dependencies.

The NLP Playground is ideal for both beginners and advanced users who want to deepen their knowledge of NLP techniques in a practical, code-based environment. By using SpaCy's powerful features, users can gain valuable insights into text data and build a strong foundation for developing more complex NLP models.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- SpaCy

This project serves as a useful tool for students, researchers, and practitioners interested in diving into the world of Natural Language Processing.
